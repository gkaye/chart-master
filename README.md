## Chart Master
_**Please bear in mind that I made this project ~8 years ago**_  Chart Master is a java program designed to test your ability to read stock charts.

#### How to use:
A pre-compiled jar file has been uploaded for convenience, along with a sample stock data file called "sample.csv".  Find it in the "running example" folder.  When asked for a file, simply select "sample.csv". This file is a sample, and as such repeats the same information over and over again.  Expect to see the same situation more than once.
Chart Master is designed such that you make your prediction x candles in the future.  Change this by selecting "Set prediction distance".
